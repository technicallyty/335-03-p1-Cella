Intro

  This project draws a 41x41 grid and runs a visible (triangle) bot from the center of the grid. 
  The bot first determines the current color of the cell its on then changes it's head orientation 
  based on this color. It then increments the color of the cell it is on followed by moving 
  one cell over in the direction it is facing. The above describes the behavior of the implemented 
  algorithm, TP Ant #x15.

  This is a project using HTML, Javascript (JS), and P5.js
  which is a JS-adapted version of the Processing Language.  CF HTML and
  JS on the web (eg, Wikipedia).  More on P5 is at
  p5js.org/reference.and at github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki.

  P5 provides sutomated animation (via a user-built "draw" function),
  and GUI manipulation functions that are simpler than JS.

Zip Contents
	
  File BigO.txt  This file contains our analysis of the algorithm in terms of Big O.

  File readme.txt.  This file.

  File pix-js-p5-1000moves.  A screenshot of the grid after 1000 bot moves.
 
  Folder src - Contains the contents below.

  File index.html. Double click this file to run in your default browser, or drag and drop to your preferred browser.
    Hit (almost) any key to toggle bot on or off (via keyPressed).

  File p5.js. This is the P5 package. 

  File cs-sketch.js; This contains several P5 user-defined linkage functions
   (setup, draw, keyPressed)  
   P5's setup() is run once before page display.
   P5's draw() is run once per display frame, so you can do animation.

  File assets/styles.css.  This is an extra-small example of controlling
    webpage styling.  // Loaded inside the html.

  File assets/draw-stuff.js. This defines the look/layout of the grid.

Installation & Running

  1. Extract the .zip file into a folder.

  2. Double click the index.html to run in your default browser, or drag n drop the index.html file to your preferred browser.
     You should see a black grid with a gray background and red tick numbers on the axis. 

Known Bugs

None

Warnings

None

Features:
  All features as requested by the Cella Ant #x15 are present in the program.
  
  Extra: You can key-press (almost any key) to stop the bot as provided by professor Siska.

  Some code was borrowed and modified from Stuart's book.  
    Introducing JavaScript Game Development: Build a 2D Game from the
    Ground Up, by Graeme Stuart, 2018, 209 pages.

  Some code was left over from professor Siska's example files.

  A snippet was borrowed from stack overflow to convert an rgb component to hex string.

  And, of course, thanks to the HTML and P5.js developers.
